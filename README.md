## üöÄ 30-Day Coding Challenge: Day 15

This project is the fifteenth entry in my 30-day coding challenge. Today's goal was to build a fundamental and widely-used UI component‚Äîthe accordion‚Äîusing React. This project focuses on component composition, managing state for UI visibility, and creating smooth user interactions.

### üìñ Project Overview

This is a clean and responsive FAQ-style accordion component built entirely with React. The application displays a list of questions, and clicking on any question smoothly expands its corresponding answer while collapsing any other open item. This demonstrates a "one-at-a-time" accordion behavior, which is a common and user-friendly pattern.

### üåü Key Features

* **Reusable Components:** The application is built by composing a reusable `AccordionItem` child component within a parent `Accordion` component.
* **Single Open Item:** The state is managed so that only one accordion item can be open at a time, providing a clean user experience.
* **Smooth CSS Transitions:** The opening and closing of items are animated using CSS transitions on the `max-height` property, creating a polished effect.
* **Dynamic Rendering from Data:** The entire accordion is dynamically generated by mapping over a JavaScript array of data, making it easy to update and maintain.
* **Stateful Logic:** Uses the `useState` hook to manage which accordion item is currently active.
* **Modern Styling:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern aesthetic.

### üíª Technologies Used

This project continues to build on modern front-end libraries within a simple, accessible setup.

![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

* **React:** The core library for building the user interface.
* **ReactDOM:** Used to render the React component into the browser's DOM.
* **Babel:** Used as a transpiler to convert JSX into standard JavaScript.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and layout.
* **Font Awesome:** For the chevron icons.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

This project is set up to be extremely simple to run, with no build process required:

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the code):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/timothy-agboada/react-accordion.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-accordion
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.** The CDN links will handle loading all necessary libraries automatically.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

This project was a practical exercise in several key React patterns:

* **Component Composition:** Understanding how to build complex UI by nesting smaller, reusable components.
* **Lifting State Up:** Managing the state (`openIndex`) in the parent `Accordion` component to control the behavior of its children.
* **Passing Functions as Props:** Passing the `handleClick` function from the parent down to the child components to allow them to communicate back up the tree.
* **Conditional Rendering & Styling:** Applying classes and rendering content based on a component's state (`isOpen`) to control visibility and animations.
* **Mapping Data to Components:** Reinforcing the standard React pattern of using `.map()` to render a list of components from an array of data.
